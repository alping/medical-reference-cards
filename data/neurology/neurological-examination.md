**Standing**
- Walk across the room
- Walk on toes/heels
- Squat and rise
- Sight and hearing

**Sitting**
- Face: Symmetry, ptos
- Pupils: Size, reaction to light
- Eye movements: Nystagmus, diplopia
- Sight: Donder's test
- Mouth and throat: Symmetry, swallow reflex, gingival hyperplasia, cranial nerve XII
- Sensibility to light touch, corneal reflex
- Pain sensibility
- Vibration sensibility
- Motoric function for crainal nerve V, VII, XI
- Reflexes in arms and legs
- Grasset's test
- Auskultation of lungs
- Palpate lymph nodes
- (Smell and taste)

**Lying down**
- Barr√©
- Muscle strength: proximal + distal in arms and legs
- Muscle tonus, atrophies, fasciculations, tremor,
- Heel-knee test
- Dysdiadochokinesis
- Pulse, blood pressure, heart, vascular examination, palpate abdomen
